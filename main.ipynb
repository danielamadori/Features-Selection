    "# Introduction to Feature Selection Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is part of a project focused on exploring various feature selection techniques to enhance the performance of machine learning models. The project uses the \"Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)\" dataset, applying methods like Mutual Information Feature Selection (MIFS), Correlation Feature Selection (CFS), and Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) among others, to identify the most significant features for accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to provide a comprehensive analysis of these feature selection techniques, compare their effectiveness, and understand their impact on model performance. By the end of this notebook, we should have a clear understanding of which features are most important and why, as well as insights into the strengths and limitations of each feature selection method used.\n",

    "1. **Data Preparation**: Begin with continuous numerical data, and sort it in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initial Binning**: Create initial bins, typically with a fixed number of data points or fixed width.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Chi-Squared Statistic**: Calculate the chi-squared statistic for each pair of adjacent bins using observed and expected frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chi-Squared Test**: Apply a chi-squared test to decide whether to merge adjacent bins or keep them separate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterate**: Continue merging adjacent bins with chi-squared statistics below the threshold until you reach the desired number of bins or all chi-squared statistics exceed the threshold.\n",

    "6. **Final Binning**: The boundaries of the bins represent the discrete intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Discretization**: Replace the continuous data with bin labels to indicate which bin each data point belongs to."
